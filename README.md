### What I learned

In the course of this project, I learnt how to implement the following:
- Drag and Drop in React.JS
- Proper use of Hooks in React.JS
- How to handle multiple checkboxes in React.JS
- How to delete an item from an array using filter()

### Useful resources

- [Drag and Drop in React (Functional Component)](https://www.aurigait.com/blog/drag-and-drop-in-react/) - This helped me to understand and implement drag and drop. I really liked the pattern as it was clearly explained with an example.
- [Handling multiple checkboxes in React.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-work-with-multiple-checkboxes-in-react/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand handling multiple checkboxes in react. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
